I need to complete the VaultLogic website by generating the missing files. The existing Flask application has the core structure with routes, models, forms, and most templates. I need to create:

1. Contact form template with proper styling
2. CSS styling that matches the professional enterprise design
3. Main JavaScript for general functionality
4. Chat JavaScript for the interactive demo
5. A comprehensive compliance handbook PDF (simulated as text content since we can't generate actual PDFs)

The design should be professional, enterprise-focused with dark navy and blue accent colors, responsive layout, and smooth interactions. The chat functionality needs to work with the existing Flask backend that searches through compliance content.

# useful_guidelines_from_blueprints

From the Flask guidelines:
- Listen on port 5000 when starting a server
- Use Bootstrap 5 for UI components and responsive design
- Implement smooth scrolling navigation and interactive elements
- Create beautiful, functional, and production-ready design
- Favor creating web applications with proper form handling
